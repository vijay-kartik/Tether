# Consumer rules for space.pitchstone:tether-core.
#
# These are applied automatically to any app that depends on this artifact, so a consumer with
# minification enabled does not have to know about the SDK's internals to ship a working build.

# --- Wire / generated WAProto ---
# Wire resolves each message's ADAPTER field reflectively when decoding nested and unknown
# fields. Stripping or renaming it turns every decode into a runtime failure.

# --- libsignal ---
# The Signal protocol library reflects over its own state classes, and its native curve
# implementation is resolved by name.
