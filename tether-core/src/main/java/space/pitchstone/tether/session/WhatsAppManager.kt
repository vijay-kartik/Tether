/**
 * Owner of the native WhatsApp connection: builds the Room-backed stores, runs the [WAClient] on
 * a background scope (via [WaForegroundService]), tracks what has been observed, and exposes
 * connection state (incl. QR codes) for the UI.
 *
 * This is the whole "login and message observing" surface — QR pairing, connect/reconnect,
 * logout, and a running log of messages seen on the connection — with no dependency on any
 * particular app's pipeline. A host app hands [onMessages] a callback to do something with
 * decrypted messages (feed them into its own agent/pipeline, store them, whatever); it can later
 * call [annotate] to attach a note to a message already shown (e.g. what its pipeline decided),
 * without this module needing to know what that pipeline is.
